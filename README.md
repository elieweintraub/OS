OS
==

A collection of short C programs written for the OS class at Cooper Union 


Projects include:

    ps1 - Copycat 
          A simplified version of the cat unix utility

    ps2 - Recursive Lister (rls)
	        Performs a traversal of the file system starting at the
	        specified directory and prints information about every
	        node in a format similar to what would be displayed 
	        with the unix utility ls -lR

    ps3 - Simple Command Shell
	        Demonstrates the unix kernel fork/exec model for 
	        executing commands by implementing a very simple
	        shell

    ps4 - CatGrepMore Pipeline
	        Allows a user to specify a list of files and a 
	        pattern. The files are read using cat and passed
	        through grep to search for the pattern. Output is
	        displayed using the more command.

    ps5 - Demonstration of mmap
	        Test programs to demonstrate how mmap works

    ps6 - TCP/UDP Server and Client
	        Socket programming to create simple client and
        	server prgorams for TCP and UDP data transfer
        	protocols

    ps7 - Concurrency
	        Implements a semaphore protected FIFO queue 
	        that can be accessed by multiple users without
	        loss of data. Test program included.

    ps8 - Assembly and Function Calls
	        Some simple assembly code and a test program
	        to illustrate the cost of function calls 
	        versus system calls
	
More detailed explanations for each assignment can be found in the respective directories.
